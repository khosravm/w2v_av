"Simple method for doc2vec generation": Averaging w2v
There are different ways to make document embeddings from meaningful word embeddings: 
- Take a document, apply some word embedding method like word2vec (cbow or skip-gram). 
- Then, to summarize resulted word vectors into a single vector in the same embedding space; common
summarization operators like average or sum (here averaging method) are used.
